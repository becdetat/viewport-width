viewport-width
==============

Uses jQuery to display the current viewport width. Useful for setting up `@media` CSS selectors.

The width is calculated using the method found here: <http://responsejs.com/labs/dimensions/>.

Just include a link to the script after jQuery is included. The script will take care of the rest.
