viewport-width
==============

Uses jQuery to display the current viewport width.

The width is calculated using the method found here: <http://responsejs.com/labs/dimensions/>.

Just include a link to the script after jQuery is included. The script will take care of the rest.

	<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>
	..to come
